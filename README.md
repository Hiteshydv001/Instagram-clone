HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to:<br>

Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.<br>
Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.<br>
Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.<br>
Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.<br>
With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on.<br>
